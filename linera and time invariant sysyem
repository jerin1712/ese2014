A linear and time-invariant system is described by the difference equation.
y(n)-0.5y(n-1)+0.25y(n-2)=x(n)+2x(n-1)+x(n-3)

1.	Using the filter function, compute and plot the impulse response of the system over 0<=n<=100

CODE:
b = [1,2,0,1];
 a = [1,-0.5,0.25];
 [x,n] = impseq(0,0,100);
h = filter(b,a,x);
subplot(2,1,2); stem(n,h); title('Impulse Response');
 xlabel('n'); ylabel('h(n)');
